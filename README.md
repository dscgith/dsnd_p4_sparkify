### Libraries used
+ PySpark
+ Pandas
+ Numpy
+ Matplotlib
+ datetime
+ re
+ IPython

Python Version 3.6.3 was used for this project

---

### Motivation
For this project my goal was to get a better understanding of big data handling, using PySpark, and get some experience with the common ML topic of customer churn prediction on a big dataset. 

---

### Data
The used dataset contains a small subset of a larger dataset mimicking the usage log of a music streaming service. This subset contains 128 MB of data.  

| filename | file description |
| :-- | :-- |
| mini_sparkify_event_data.json | A list of user interactions with the music streaming service, e.g. sub sites visited, listened songs, registration date etc. |

This dataset was provided by Udacity.
